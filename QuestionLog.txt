1     Good Morning Mr Smith How are you doing today     
2     I am Dr Trauma and this is a polytrauma clinic  You are here because you have earlier screened positive for TBI So this is the next step evaluation in those who screened positive for TBI The initial screen is usually very brief and does not give us a lot of information to diagnose someone with TBI  In this session I will be asking you more detailed questions so that we can better understand your symptoms and be able to come up with a specific diagnosis Do you have any questions for me at this time     
3     Let me clarify it for you On your previous visit the doctor asked you a few brief questions to see if you screened positive for a more detailed evaluation which will be done today Screening positive does not mean that you have TBI     
4     Okay Lets get started I am going to ask you to describe for me in detail events you experienced in Iraq Afghanistan during which time you directly experienced a powerful force or blow to your upper body or head You may or may not have been physically injured This might have happened in explosion or blast crashes or accidents fights falls or even during some sporting events I am interested in understanding this physical force on you Some events may be very emotionally powerful or upsetting but for now I am going to ask you to focus on the event that was most powerful or injurious Of course it may also have been emotionally disturbing      
5     Glad to know that we are on the same page Do you have any question about the type of event that is the focus of this interview     
6     Can describe the events surrounding your accident      
7     Did you lose consciousness     
8     So were you medevaced       
9     Impact could vary depending on several factors such as how far you were from the blast site did you fall away did you have any penetrating wounds did you lose consciousness etc Let me just brief you a bit about it When a high explosive bomb or IED goes off there is a blast wave which is a wave of highly compressed gas A couple of things could happen here one this wave hits a solid objects like a persons body and one may feel like smashing into a wall two one could be peppered with particles of sand debris shrapnel and fragments three you could be thrown to the ground or against some stationary object like a wall or vehicle Can you recall which of these three categories happened with you     
10     Can you recall the approximate distance from the blast site     
11     Did any of these objects penetrate you skull     
12     Immediately after the event how was your ability to function affected if at all     
13     What did your buddies or other soldiers at the scene tell you afterward about this event     
14     Tell me about your first meal after this event Was it unusual in any way     
15     How did you feel the next morning when you got up Were you able to functional at your baseline     
16     Now let fast forward to one week Were you experiencing these symptoms a week after the event How was your day to day functioning     
17     Now lets talk about your current symptoms I will ask you some specific symptoms that you might have experienced and I would like you to grade them based on their severity For example None or zero mean that they are rarely ever present One means that they are occasionally present but they do not disrupt your activities You can usually continue what you are doing and doesnt really concerns you Two means that they are often present and occasionally disrupt your activity You can usually continue to do what you are doing with some effort and you are somewhat concerned about it Three means that they are frequently present and disrupts your regular activities You can only do things that are fairly simple or take little effort You feel like you need help Four means that they are almost always present and you have been unable to perform at work school or at home due to this problem You probably cannot function without help Please let me know if you want me to repeat the grading criteria as it can be a bit confusing    
18     Okay lets begin Feel free to stop me if you are unable to follow or if I was too quick Do you feeling dizzy dizzy is when you are spinning and not things around you    
19     Do you feel that you have poor coordination   
20     Did you experience these symptoms prior to your injury     
21     Let me ask you do you believe that you have brain injury or TBI     
22     What are your goals in term of physical and psychological recovery      
23     Thank you for your patience in answering the questions and for your service I think I have got all the information that I needed to come up with a thorough assessment to see if you suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury In my opinion you may be suffering from TBI I will contact our social worker to see how she can help you with any additional resources     
24     Do you have any questions for me
